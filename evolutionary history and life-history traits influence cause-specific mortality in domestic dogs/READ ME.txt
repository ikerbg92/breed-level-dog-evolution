This file contains all the necessary information to use the data and code to reproduce the analyses for the paper "Evolutionary History and Life History Traits Influence Cause-Specific Mortality in Domestic Dogs"

The complete life history dataset can be identified by the name "data", and is provided in two versions: 

1. data (excel file) contains extra headers with self-explanatory column names.

2. data (.csv file) contains data without those extra headers to easily export the dataset to R.

Both "data" files are identical except by the extra headers and include the following information by column (ordered left to right):

A. breed code name from Parker et al. 2017
B. breed code name from Garamszegi et al. 2020
C and D. common breed name and synonym (if any)

E to G. Careau et al. 2010 data on behaviour

H to AK. Adult weight data by source listed below. Adult weight data can be identified by the letter "w" at the beginning of the cell name. 
Some sources report adult weight as a range, thus numbers "1" and "2" following the letter "w" refer to the lower and upper values of such range. Column AK contains weight variable used in the paper.

AL to AX. Lifespan data by source. lifespan data can be identified by the letter "l" at the beginning of the cell name. 
Some sources report lifespan as range, thus numbers "1" and "2" following the letter "l" refer to the lower and upper values of the range. Column AW contains the lifespan data used in the analyses of our article.

AY to BU. Litter size data by source. litter size data can be identified by the letters "ls" at the beginning of the cell name. 
Column BS contains litter size data used in the analyses of our article.

BV to CG. Neonate weight data by source. Neonate weight data can be identified by the letters "bw" (for "birth weight") 
at the beginning of the cell name.

CH. Reproductive investment data calculated as = birth weight in kg (bwkg) multiplied by litter size (ls) = "bwkgxls".

CI to CN. growth data from Hawthorne et al. (2004) and Posada et al. (2014). These data were used to compare with our growth estimate (CO)

CO. Growth data calculated as stated in methods.

CP to DL. VMDB data reported by Fleming et al. 2011.

3. Code.

* Please note that the SNP‐based (“common ancestry”) and haplotype‐based (“haplotype sharing”) matrices used in this study are original supplementary materials from Garamszegi et al. (2020): The role of common ancestry and gene flow in the evolution of human-directed play behaviour in dogs (Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 33: 318–328). We used these matrices without modification, restricting them only to the subset of dog breeds for which mortality data were available in the present study.
