This folder contains all data files, code, and derived results required to reproduce the analyses presented in the article:

“Evolutionary history and life-history traits influence cause-specific mortality in domestic dogs.”

All analyses are conducted at the breed level and are fully reproducible using the files provided here.

1. Data files

The complete life-history and mortality dataset is provided under the name data, in two equivalent formats:

data.xlsx: An Excel version including additional header rows with self-explanatory column labels to facilitate inspection and manual exploration.

data.csv: A plain CSV version without extra headers, intended for direct import into R and other statistical software.

Both files contain identical data and differ only the additional header of the .xlsx version.

2. Structure of the main dataset (data)

Columns are ordered from left to right as follows:

A–B: Breed code names following Parker et al. (2017) and Garamszegi et al. (2020)

C–D: Common breed name and synonym (if available).

E–G: Behavioural trait data from Careau et al. (2010).

H–AK: Adult weight data compiled from multiple sources. Columns starting with “w” indicate adult weight values. When weight is reported as a range, suffixes 1 and 2 correspond to lower and upper bounds. Column AK contains the adult body mass variable used in the analyses.

AL–AX: Lifespan data. Columns starting with “l” correspond to lifespan estimates. As above, 1 and 2 indicate lower and upper bounds when ranges are reported. Column AW contains the lifespan variable used in the article.

AY–BU: Litter size data. Columns starting with “ls” correspond to litter size estimates. Column BS contains the litter size variable used in the analyses.

BV–CG: Neonatal (birth) weight data. Columns starting with “bw” correspond to birth weight estimates.

CH: Reproductive investment. Reproductive investment calculated as: birth weight (kg) × litter size, labelled as bwkgxls.

CI–CN: Growth data from published sources. Growth estimates from Hawthorne et al. (2004) and Posada et al. (2014), used for comparison with our derived growth metric (CO).

CP–DL: Mortality data. Breed-level cause-of-death data derived from the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB), as reported in Fleming et al. (2011), classified by organ system (OS) or pathophysiological process (PP)

3. Genetic similarity matrices used as random effects in the Bayesian models:

snps.csv — SNP-based similarity matrix (common ancestry)

haplotypes.csv — haplotype-sharing matrix (hybridization)

These matrices are derived from the original supplementary materials of: Garamszegi, L. Z., Temrin, H., Kubinyi, E., Miklósi, Á., & Kolm, N. (2020). The role of common ancestry and gene flow in the evolution of human-directed play behaviour in dogs.
Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 33(3), 318–328.

The matrices provided here are restricted to the subset of dog breeds for which mortality and life-history data are available in the present study, but are otherwise unmodified in structure.

4. Code. 

R script is commented and organized to allow full reproducibility of the analyses.

5. Final results object

The file finalresults.RData contains saved R model outputs.

6. Notes on reuse

All data and code are provided for transparency and reproducibility. Users are encouraged to cite the associated article and the original data sources when reusing these materials.
