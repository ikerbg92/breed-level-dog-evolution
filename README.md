Why this repository?

Domestic dog breeds provide a unique opportunity to study evolutionary processes over short timescales. Through domestication and subsequent breed formation, dogs have diversified into populations that differ markedly in morphology, life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and disease susceptibility, while sharing a recent common ancestry. Because breeds are shaped by well-documented selection regimes and exhibit strong genetic structure, comparisons at the breed level allow evolutionary hypotheses to be tested in a natural “replicated experiment.” Studying differences among breeds therefore offers insight into how evolutionary history, genetic relatedness, and life-history trade-offs jointly shape patterns of health, ageing, and mortality. More broadly, dog breeds serve as a powerful comparative system for understanding how selection, constraint, and shared ancestry interact to generate biological diversity in complex traits.

This repository serves as an open and evolving resource for the analysis of breed-level differences in domestic dogs. It will be continuously updated with data, R code, and documentation used to study variation among dog breeds. In addition to supporting ongoing and future projects, the repository openly hosts the datasets and analytical workflows underlying already published or accepted articles. By centralizing these materials, the repository aims to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reuse, while providing a shared foundation for comparative and evolutionary research on domestic dog breeds.

Evolutionary history and life-history traits influence cause-specific mortality in domestic dogs: this section contains the data, code, and documentation associated with the article “Evolutionary history and life-history traits influence cause-specific mortality in domestic dogs” (JEB-2025-00317). It includes processed datasets, Bayesian multinomial model scripts, and figure-generation code used to analyse breed-level variation in mortality patterns while accounting for genetic relatedness, life-history traits, and sampling structure. The SNP-based and haplotype-sharing genetic similarity matrices included here were subset and adapted to match the set of breeds available for this study.
